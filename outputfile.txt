Java Byte streams are used to perform input and output of 8-bit bytes. To write Bytes using BytesStream to a file Java provides a specialized stream for writing files in the file system known as FileOutputStream. This stream provides the basic OutputStream functionality applied for writing the contents of a file.

FileOutputStream class is an output stream for writing data to a file. It is a class that belongs to byte streams.The FileOutputStream class extends the OutputStream abstract class.So it inherits all the standard OutputStream functionality for writing to a file.FileOutputStream provides only a low-level interface to writing data. You can create a FileOutputStream from a String pathname or a File object.The FileOutputStream constructors don’t throw a FileNotFoundException. If the specified file doesn’t exist, the FileOutputStream creates the file. The FileOutputStream constructors can throw an IOException if some other I/O error occurs. If the specified file does exist, the FileOutputStream opens it for writing. When you actually call a write() method, the new data overwrites the current contents of the file. To append data to an existing file, use a different constructor that accepts an append flag.
